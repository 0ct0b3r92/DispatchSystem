# Dispatch Systems

> Dispatch Systems is a CAD/MDT system for ingame FiveM use, this is not a permenant solution, but it works for free. This is an open source free project courtesy of BlockBa5her (the coder). It is free for anyone to use, as long as they do not re-distribute the software under their own name. It does not store data in CouchDB and MySQL so EssentialMode is not needed. It stores all of the player's information in the RAM of the computer, so the next restart of the server clears all of the names that it has stored. It now also comes with database settings for saving Civilian Profiles and Vehicles to 2 files.

## Uses

* For a community just starting up and not having the money to pay for a CAD/MDT system that costs money
* Easy use with long lasting terms
* Terminal outside of game for Dispatcher use
* Built in 911 calling system
* A great author that will always keep it updated
* C# with open source code
* Availability to everyone, not just people who pay
* Open for suggestions and always looking for more to add-on too
* Will always stay non-SQL/CouchDB based for easy use (with included database settings)
