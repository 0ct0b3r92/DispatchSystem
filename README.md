## Summary

Dispatch Systems is a CAD/MDT system for ingame FiveM use, this is not a permenant solution, but it works for free. This is an open source free project courtesy of BlockBa5her (the coder). It is free for anyone to use, as long as they do not re-distribute the software under their own name. It does not store data in CouchDB and MySQL so EssentialMode is not needed. It stores all of the player's information in the RAM of the computer, but saves all of the data once the server is restarted. It now also comes with storage settings for saving Civilian Profiles and Vehicles in a file.

## Uses

* For a community just starting up and not having the money to pay for a CAD/MDT system that costs money
* Easy use with long lasting terms
* Terminal outside of game for Dispatcher use
* Built in 911 calling system
* A great author that will always keep it updated
* C# with open source code
* Availability to everyone, not just people who pay
* Open for suggestions and always looking for more to add-on too
* Will always stay non-SQL/CouchDB based for easy use (with included storage settings)

## In the works

1. Arrest ability - `/arrest {first} {last}` arrests a ped and show it in the system
2. Warrant Types - `/warrant {type}` have different types of bench warrants and also a toggle for outstanding
3. Bug fixes - There seems to be a lot of bugs that popped up in v2.0 of DispatchSystem, I'm hard at working trying to fix all of them
